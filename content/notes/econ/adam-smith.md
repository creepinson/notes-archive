summary: "Adam Smith's Invisible Hand"
---


By helping yourself, your skills lead to helping others (eg. your baking skills -> money -> baking more food -> food for other people). Everyone is striving for the most advantageous employment (the best job). People have the liberty/freedom to pursue their own interests. The goal of our government is to create a military, a justice system, and certain public institutions (eg. a library). People do their jobs to get money, not to just make people happy. This ties into the concept of opportunity cost.

In conclusion, Adam Smithâ€™s concept of the invisible hand means that people will do things for their own interest which results in helping other people.
